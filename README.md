# DS Build Week scaffold

Here's a template with starter code to deploy an API for your machine learning model and data visualizations.  You're encouraged (but not required) to use this template for your Build Week.

You can deploy on Heroku in 10 minutes. Here's the template deployed as-is: [https://ds-bw-test.herokuapp.com/](https://ds-bw-test.herokuapp.com/)

This diagram shows two different ways to use frameworks like Flask. Both ways are good! The first way is what you learned in DS Unit 3. The second way is more common in Build Weeks & Labs.

Instead of Flask, we'll use FastAPI. It's similar, but faster, with automatic interactive docs. For more comparison, see [FastAPI for Flask Users](https://amitness.com/2020/06/fastapi-vs-flask/).

You'll build and deploy a Data Science API. You'll work cross-functionally with your Web teammates to connect your API to a full-stack web app!

## Tech stack
- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/): Web framework. Like Flask, but faster, with automatic interactive docs.
- [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/): Linter, enforces PEP8 style guide.
- [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/): Platform as a service, hosts your API.
- [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/): Reproducible virtual environment, manages dependencies.
- [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/): Visualization library, for Python & JavaScript.
- [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/): Testing framework, runs your unit tests.

## Getting started

[Create a new repository from this template.](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/ds-bw/generate)

Clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO-NAME.git

cd YOUR-REPO-NAME
```

Install dependencies
```
pipenv install --dev

git add Pipfile.lock

git commit -m "Add Pipfile.lock"
```

Activate the virtual environment
```
pipenv shell
```

Launch the app
```
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

You'll see your API documentation:

- Your app's title, "DS API"
- Your description, "Lorem ipsum"
- An endpoint for POST requests, `/predict`
- An endpoint for GET requests, `/vis/{statecode}`

Click the `/predict` endpoint's green button.

You'll see the endpoint's documentation, including:

- Your function's docstring, """Make random baseline predictions for classification problem."""
- Request body example, as [JSON](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/JSON) (like a Python dictionary)
- A button, "Try it out"

Click the "Try it out" button.

The request body becomes editable. 

Click the "Execute" button. Then scroll down.

You'll see the server response, including:

- [Code 200](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/200), which means the request was successful.
- The response body, as [JSON](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/JSON), with random baseline predictions for a classification problem.

***Your job is to replace these random predictions with real predictions from your model. Use this starter code and documentation to deploy your model as an API!***

`app/main.py` is where you edit your app's title and description, which are displayed at the top of the your automatically generated documentation. This file also configures "Cross-Origin Resource Sharing", which you shouldn't need to edit.

- [FastAPI docs - Metadata](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/metadata/)
- [FastAPI docs - CORS](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/cors/)

`app/api/predict.py` defines the **Machine Learning** endpoint. `/predict` accepts POST requests and responds with random predictions. In a notebook, train your model and pickle it. Then in this source code file, unpickle your model and edit the `predict` function to return real predictions.

- [Scikit-learn docs - Model persistence](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_persistence.html)
- [Keras docs - Serialization and saving](https://keras.io/guides/serialization_and_saving/)

When your API receives a POST request, FastAPI automatically parses and validates the request body JSON, using the `Item` class attributes and functions. Edit this class so it's consistent with the column names and types from your training dataframe.

- [pydantic docs - Validators](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/validators/)

`app/api/viz.py` defines the **Visualization** endpoint. Currently `/viz/{statecode}` accepts GET requests where `{statecode}` is a 2 character US state postal code, and responds with a Plotly figure of the state's unemployment rate, as a JSON string. Create your own Plotly visualizations in notebooks. Then add your code to this source code file. Your web developer teammates can use [react-plotly.js](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/labs-spa-starter/tree/main/src/components/pages/ExampleDataViz) to show the visualizations.

- [Lambda School docs - Data visualization with React & Plotly](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/labs-spa-starter/tree/main/src/components/pages/ExampleDataViz). This is the code for the above example. Your web teammates can reuse this as-is.

`app/tests/test_*.py` is where you edit your pytest unit tests.
